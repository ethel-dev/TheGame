About
=====

TheGame is an experimental "game" that involves figuring out what is inside a box. It will do many things, including opening your notepad and typing stuff into it right before your eyes, opening websites, and spitting out random numbers. Its interesting, addictive, and it makes you want to double click on the small .exe file every single time.
